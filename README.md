# Random Number Generator with Repetitions

This project is a simple C# application that generates a list of random integers with specific repetition requirements. The list contains 10 numbers where at least one number repeats twice and another number repeats three times.

## Functionality

The application performs the following:
- Generates a list of 10 random integers between 1 and 50.
- Ensures that at least one number repeats exactly twice.
- Ensures that at least one other number repeats exactly three times.
- Displays the final list of numbers.
